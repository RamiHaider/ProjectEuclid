Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)
What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems 
that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics
will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming
skills will be required to solve most problems."

For me it's a way to stay sharp with Python, and incorporate any new techniques that I learn
into practical ways. I also like that it involves mathematical insight to solve the problem
and that you need your code to be efficient, otherwise you won't be able to produce the solution.
